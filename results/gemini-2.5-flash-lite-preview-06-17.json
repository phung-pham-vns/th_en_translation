It directly translates 'ใบทุเรียน' to 'durian leaves' and 'ระยะเติบโต' to 'growth stages', which is a precise rendering. The ground truth 'What are the key stages of durian leaf development?' adds 'key' and uses 'development' instead of 'growth'. While 'development' is a good synonym for 'เติบโต' and 'key' can be implied by 'ใดบ้าง' (asking for specific types/stages), the model's direct translation is still excellent and conveys the full meaning clearly. The difference is minor stylistic preference for slightly more specific terminology in the ground truth."
