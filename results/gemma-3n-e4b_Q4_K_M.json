The term 'fruit set' is a very precise and correct horticultural term for the initiation of fruit development, which is exactly what paclobutrazol aims to achieve to make durian 'ออกผล' (bear fruit) off-season.

The use of 'diagnose' is an excellent and precise translation for 'วินิจฉัย' (to diagnose a disease). The only minor deviation is the addition of 'I' as the subject ('How can I diagnose'), whereas the original Thai 'จะ...ได้อย่างไร' implies a more general or impersonal question ('How can one/it be diagnosed'), which the reference translation captures with the passive voice ('can be identified'). However, this subtle difference does not significantly impede understanding or naturalness in English."
