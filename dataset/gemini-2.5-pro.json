However, it misses two subtle nuances present in the original Thai and captured in the reference: 1) The 'มีอะไรบ้าง' in Thai suggests asking about 'kinds of' or multiple types of damage, which the model translates as 'what is the general damage' (singular). 2) The reference explicitly states 'to durian', making the object of the damage clearer, whereas the model implies it through 'Durian Seed Borer'."
