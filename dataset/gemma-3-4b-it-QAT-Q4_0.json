The only minor nuance is the introduction of 'I' ('How can I diagnose'), whereas the original Thai 'จะวินิจฉัย...ได้อย่างไร' is more general, akin to 'How can one diagnose?' or 'How can it be diagnosed?', which the reference's passive voice ('be identified') captures.

'general damages' is less natural than 'common damage' or 'kinds of common damage' for 'ความเสียหายทั่วไป'. More significantly, it translates 'หนอนเจาะเมล็ดทุเรียน' as 'Durian Seed Borer,' omitting the specific mention of 'หนอน' (larvae/worm) which is present in the source and is a key detail about the agent causing the damage. The capitalized 'Durian Seed Borer' suggests a formal proper noun, which is acceptable as a pest name, but loses the specific meaning of 'larvae'."
